# faceid
Machine Learning based Face ID using a camera and raspberry Pi

To run the program, you must edit faceid.py and add your own Twilio credentials acquired free here: https://www.twilio.com/

Then, add images of known people to the ./img/known folder. You'll need to edit-in their names in faceid.py as well.
